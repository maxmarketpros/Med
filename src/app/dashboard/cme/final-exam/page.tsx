        options: ["A. Intubate immediately", "B. Initiate BiPAP with FiO2 0.4", "C. Administer albuterol nebulizer alone", "D. Start IV corticosteroids"],
        correctAnswer: "B. Initiate BiPAP with FiO2 0.4",

        correctAnswer: "D. Nicardipine IV alone",
        explanation: "Recent GI bleed is a contraindication to tPA. Permissive hypertension is allowed, but at this level, gentle blood pressure control with a titratable agent like nicardipine is recommended to prevent hemorrhagic transformation. Mechanical thrombectomy requires a confirmed large vessel occlusion."

        correctAnswer: "A. Hypokalemia",
        explanation: "Insulin therapy drives potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular space. Even with an initially high serum potassium, total body potassium is depleted in DKA. Rapid shifts can cause severe hypokalemia, precipitating life-threatening arrhythmias like VF."
